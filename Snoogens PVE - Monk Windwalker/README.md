## Recommended Core Settings  
`Use Flying Serpent Kick` depends a lot on the content you will be running and if it's safe to keep it enabled or not. It will automatically cancel as soon as possible, however it will still move you ~5 yards.

## Windwalker Toggles  
I recommend you disable Touch of Karma (`Abilities > Touch of Karma > Disable Touch of Karma`) and use it manually instead, as it's best used that way.
